# AtliQ Grants Hotel Analysis

The analysis aims to gain insights into the hotel's business performance, booking patterns, and customer preferences. It explores the provided hotel booking dataset, performs data cleaning, and conducts an exploratory data analysis to discover key trends and patterns.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is available in the `datasets` directory. It is provided in a CSV format and contains the following columns:

- `dim_date.csv`: This dataset contains information about dates and related attributes.
- `dim_hotels.csv`: This dataset contains details about different hotels, including their types and locations.
- `dim_rooms.csv`: This dataset provides information about the rooms available in the hotels, such as room types and capacities.
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`: This dataset contains aggregated information about hotel bookings, including the total number of bookings and revenue for each hotel.
- `fact_bookings.csv`: This dataset contains individual booking records with specific details, including booking dates, customer information, and room details.
- `new_data_august.csv`: This dataset contains additional data for the month of August, which can be used to update and enrich the existing analysis.

Please refer to the individual CSV files to explore the data in detail and understand the structure and content of each dataset.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `datasets`: This directory contains the hotel booking dataset in CSV format.

- `Hotel Analysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for the data analysis. It utilizes Python and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## How to Use

To view and interact with the analysis notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Locate the `Hotel Analysis.ipynb` file in the `datasets` directory.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Open the `Hotel Analysis.ipynb` notebook using the Jupyter interface.
5. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and view the results.

## Results

The analysis provides valuable insights into the hotel's performance, occupancy rates, and revenue trends. The visualizations and findings can assist in making data-driven decisions to optimize the hotel's operations and improve customer satisfaction.

## Future Work

This analysis can be extended in the future by incorporating additional datasets and performing more in-depth analyses. Additionally, machine learning models can be implemented to predict occupancy rates or forecast revenue, enabling better resource planning.
